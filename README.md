## Introduction

Virus slayer is a simple game built using pure HTML, CSS & Javascript. I made this game because I use it to practice getting to know javascript more deeply, so I can produce better results from this game. This game is inspired by the piano tiles game that I modified

## Instruction

1. Enter your name on the front page (Minimum 5 letters)
2. An alert notification will appear if the game is ready to start
3. Play by pressing the keyboard button provided, namely [D F J K]
4. Score increases by 5 every time you defeat a virus in the danger area (Defeating enemies outside the danger area will be meaningless at all)
5. Failure Points will increase by 1 if the virus hits the barrier from the laser shot
6. Game ends when failure points total 5
7. Unlimited time and get as much score as possible
